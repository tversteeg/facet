facet provides type reflection for Rust, in const contexts.

Any type that implements `Facet` trait returns a `Shape`, which describes:

  * The memory layout of the type
  * Its definition: struct fields, underlying type for newtypes, etc.
  * How to drop it in place

The `Poke` type is able to allocate (or work from a `&mut MaybeUninit<T>`)
any Facet type, and gradually initialize its fields — until the fully-built
value is moved out of the partial.

The `Peek` type helps perform read operations on any Facet type.

It comes with a derive macro that uses [unsynn](https://crates.io/crates/unsynn)
for speed of compilation.

## Ecosystem

There are separate crates for the trait, the core types, the derive macro, peek, poke,
and various serializers, deserializers, and pretty printers etc.

The hub for everything is the [facet](https://crates.io/crates/facet) crate.

You can start with its [README](https://github.com/fasterthanlime/facet/blob/main/facet/README.md).
