### READMEs

Don't edit any `README.md` files directly — edit `README.md.in` and run `just
codegen` to regenerate the READMEs.

Run `just` to make sure that tests pass.

For doc tests, you need to do `just codegen && just doc-tests`. Remember to fix
them by editing the corresponding `README.md.in`, not `README.md`.

All crates have their own readme template, except for the `facet/` crate, which
has it in the top-level `README.md.in`

### Tuple implementations

The file `tuples_impls.rs` in facet-core is generated from `gen_tuples_impls.rs`
in the `facet-codegen` crate. If you see any errors in it, do not correct them,
simply make a note of it and I will take care of it.

### Dependencies

crates like `facet-yaml`, `facet-json`, only have have a _dev_ dependency on
`facet`. For regular dependencies, they only have `facet-core`, `facet-reflect`.
This is to keep `facet-derive` out of them.
